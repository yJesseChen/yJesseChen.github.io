== About me
- I am currently a second year Ph.D. student of Applied and Computational Mathematics, advised by [https://people.math.osu.edu/xiu.16/ Prof. Dongbin Xiu].
- My research interests fall in the broad areas of scientific computing and numerical analysis. Recently, I'm working on the machine learning methods for scientific computing, specifically the data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification of physical systems governed by (stochastic) differential equations.
- During the past few years, I'm grateful to work with mentors who have great influence on me. I am also interested in and working on discontinuous Galerkin (dG) method with [https://people.math.osu.edu/xing.205/ Prof. Yulong Xing] and Finite Element Method (FEM) with [https://math.okstate.edu/people/xzhang/ Prof. Xu Zhang] and [http://www2.latech.edu/~shou/ Prof. Songming Hou].
- Please see my {{<a href="research.html" target="_self">Research page</a>}}, [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uREFJ78AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra Google Scholar] and [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuan-Chen-90 ResearchGate] for more information about my research.

== News
- This semester, I am organizing Student Computational Math Seminar with [https://math.osu.edu/people/chen.11010 Qifan Chen]. Please see [https://u.osu.edu/studentcomputationalmathseminar/ our website] for details.
